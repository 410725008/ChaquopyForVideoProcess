A program than had used MediaCodec and MediaExtractor to replace cv2.videocapture.
You just to edit the imageJAVA2PY.py , I had read the frame to imageJAVA2PY.py/test_image/array.

You have to click the second button in MainActivity to get the Video URI,
and click the third button to start the process,
It will read every frame and pass it to imageJAVA2PY.py.
  
取代cv2.videocapture的影片讀取方式
